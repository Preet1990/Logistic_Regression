# Introduction
Machine learning is a research field in computer science, artificial intelligence, and statistics. The focus of machine learning is to train algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions from data. Machine learning is especially valuable because it lets us use computers to automate decision-making processes.

You’ll find machine learning applications everywhere. Netflix and Amazon use machine learning to make new product recommendations. Banks use machine learning to detect fraudulent activity in credit card transactions, and healthcare companies are beginning to use machine learning to monitor, assess, and diagnose patients.

# Excercise
Implement a simple machine learning algorithm in Python using Scikit-learn, a machine learning tool for Python. Using a database of breast cancer tumor information, you’ll use a Logistic Regression (LR) classifer that predicts whether or not a tumor is malignant or benign.
